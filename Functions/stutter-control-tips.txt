Light Articulatory Contact: Use minimal pressure when the lips, tongue, and teeth touch to form sounds. This reduces tension in the articulators.
Speaking on the Exhale: Begin speaking as you exhale. This maintains a steady and consistent flow of air, which can help prevent blockages.
Gentle Onset: Start a word that begins with a vowel sound with a soft, gradual vocalization. This helps to initiate speech without a sudden burst of air or tension.
Diaphragmatic Breathing: Breathe from your belly rather than your chest. Deep, relaxed breathing from the diaphragm provides a steady and controlled supply of air for speaking.

Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Systematically tense and then relax different muscle groups to become more aware of and release physical tension throughout the body, including in the face and jaw.


Pausing and Phrasing: Insert brief pauses at natural breaks in a sentence, such as at punctuation marks, to speak in smaller, more manageable chunks.
Stretched Syllables: Intentionally prolong vowels and voiced consonants. This slows down the overall rate of speech and can prevent a rushed feeling.
Continuous Phonation: Maintain a constant flow of air and sound throughout a phrase. This helps to connect words and avoids choppy speech.


Pull-outs: When you get stuck on a sound, stretch it out and then smoothly transition into the rest of the word. This helps to gently release the tension of the sound.
Cancellations: After a moment of stuttering, pause briefly to release tension, and then re-say the word smoothly. This technique helps to practice saying the word with less physical tension.
